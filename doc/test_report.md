## Test ROM Results

The emulator is tested against several well known test suites to check if the emulator's
functionality is as close as possible to the original hardware. Since even the original
GameBoy devices had some bugs or unexpected behaviour, it requires a lot of effort and
continuous testing.

This document is generated by the `update-test-report` tool which runs each test rom on the
emulator for each valid device model.
To update this file, call `run --package update-test-report --release --bin update-test-report`.
